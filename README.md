## What is MDv3?

Ð¢he First Open Design Metal Detector for the Industry. This is not a metal detector for treasure hunting or airport security. This is a metal detector for manufacturers, the recycling and processing industry.

- MDv3 can protect the output production from metal particles

- MDv3 can protect machines from broken off parts from the other machines on the production line

- MDv3 can protect the input of processing manufacturing

- MDv3 can be used as an Education and Research platform

## What files are in this repository?

1. Technical drawings - Mechanical drawings, describing the complete mechanical design of MDv3's reference design. MDv3 drawings follow worldwide accepted ISO standards for formatting.
  * MDv3 main technical drawing with BOM
  * Enclosure
  * Cover
  * Frame
  * Reel
2. 3D Models - STL files for 3D printing, ready for use with your favorite 3D slicer.

## Why?
# Innovation

*Industry 4.0 requires higher level of optimization and control by the user, therefore an open design industrial metal detector is the natural step in industrial engineering, for higher output manufacturing*

**Open design breaks the vendor dependencies** and enables the system integrators to create the optimum solutions for their end users

----
## Changelog
* 20-Sep-2019 Initial reference design of MDv3

----
## Thanks to
* Manoel Yanev - For being able to turn DesignFirst's concept of MDv3 into mechanical design after studying the previous MDv2 design
* Ivan Petrov - For testing together one of the first MDv3 prototypes (internal codenames - MDv3 Red and MDv3 White)
* Mitko Vasilev, Georgi Tonchev - For the feedback during publication of the design files and DesignFirst's website
